## Project Background and Goals

MotionInput is a project lead by UCL that has spanned over multiple years of development. It aims to transform everyday computer web-cams into virtual a controller for your computer using a range of inputs, such as: Face tracking, Eye tracking, Hotspot tracking and Movement tracking.

MotionInput Bluetooth Controller aims to bring this technology to android as a standalone controller. This will allow users to connect the controller to any device that is Bluetooth controllable and control it using MotionInput technology.

The controller should be accessible to users with a wide range of ability and also work with a range of devices, such as: Mac computers, iPad's, Windows computers, Smart TV's and other Android devices.

## Project Goals

Our aim is to develop an app that can be downloaded directly from the Android app store and run on a wide range of Android devices.

The controller will connect to devices over bluetooth and should work without having to install any further software on the connected device.

The app will allow the user to control the mouse and keyboard on their devices and will also have the ability to act as a joystick controller for games devices.
