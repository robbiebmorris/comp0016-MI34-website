# Final Wireframe

After sketching and reviewing our prototypes we selected a combination of the best UI components to piece together the final deisgn. We then used Figma to draw our final design as a wire-frame. This was the final step in the design pricess and was used as a low-level blueprint to help address any final usability issues and refine any final issues.

The final design uses an initial home-page which the app will load into on launch. This home-page contains a list of paired devices that the user can click to connect to that device as well as buttons to pair nex devices, either by scanning for nearby devices or adding manually. The user can then use the navigation bar to switch between app components. 

The mouse component uses a trackpad along with buttons, while the keyboard component repurposes the devices native keyboard for input. The Game Pad is a combination of mouse and keyboard inputs, using a joy-stick and buttons displayed on the screen. 

The final design can be seen in the wire-frame below:
