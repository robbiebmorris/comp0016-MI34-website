The MotionInput Bluetooth controller comprises both front-end and back-end components. The front-end components handle user interface presentation and user interactions within the application. The application is structured around a single activity, utilizing fragments as defined UI components and a fragment manager to dynamically switch between various UI displays based on user selections. XML layouts are employed in constructing the front-end to specify the structure and appearance of UI elements.

The back-end systems deal with the Bluetooth connection related logic and use Android APIs to deal with the interactions the user makes with the UI elements of the app. The back-end also communicates with the devices system preferences to save the users presets and local data.

The diagram above provides a more comprehensive overview of the system architecture for the MotionInput Bluetooth controller application. It illustrates the front-end components, including the various UI fragments for different functionalities like face, hands, eyes, mouse, keyboard, and gamepad. 

At a very high level, the back-end components related to Bluetooth connectivity are also shown, in an attempt to show the flow of operations for establishing Bluetooth connectivity with target devices. The Bluetooth section shows the flow of establishing a Bluetooth connection with a target device. The system will either reconnect to a stored device using autoreconnect or scan for new devices using the Discovery component, which adds found devices to the Target Device Storage. In reality, the system is significantly more complicated than this and there are many dependencies on different bluetooth components, but this abstracted view will help you understand what the program ends up doing.

The Bluetooth Main component is the central controller for Bluetooth operations, managing the connection process with the help of other components like Bluetooth Manager" and HID (Human Interface Device). The connection is facilitated through the "Bluetooth Manager" component, which utilizes the stored device information from the Target Device Storage. Our design emphasises separation of concerns between the front-end UI components, the back-end Bluetooth components, and MotionInput components.

<div class="img-center"> ![High-level System Architecture](../../static/img/sys-design/permissions.png) </div>

A variety of permissions are needed from the user's operating system in order to use the app. These include bluetooth, location, and audio (for the speech feature) to name a few. This diagram shows how our application handles these permissions. Our application is structured around a single activity, so when the user opens the app, the main activity requests the necessary permissions through a dedicated permissions fragment. This fragment sends an inquiry to the operating system, which prompts the user to grant or deny the requested permissions. With the required permissions acquired, the main activity can then access the corresponding protected features of the application. This permission model ensures user privacy and control over what data and device capabilities an application can access, promoting transparency and security.


## Design Patterns

Here is a list of design patterns which we employed to make our application.

|Design Pattern| Use|
|--------------|-----|
|Singleton Pattern| The BluetoothManager class follows the Singleton design pattern, ensuring that only a single instance of the BluetoothMain class is created throughout the codebase. This pattern is useful when you need to control object creation and have a single, centralized point of access to an instance of a class.
|Observer Pattern|The Discovery class utilizes the Observer pattern to notify interested parties (e.g., UI fragments) when new Bluetooth devices are found during the scanning process. This pattern promotes loose coupling between the subject (Discovery) and observers (UI fragments).|
|Strategy Pattern| The various settings classes (GamePadSettings, MouseSettings, KeyboardSettings) implement different strategies for handling settings-related operations. This pattern allow the application to switch between different strategies at runtime, promoting flexibility and extensibility.|
|Template Method Pattern|Used for implementing each of the respective controllers (Mouse, Keyboard, and Gamepad), preventing the developers (us) from unnecessarily rewriting code.|
|Chain of Responsibility pattern| The bluetooth services is setup to process devices in using a chain of responsibility, allowing each bluetooth class to have a clear defined purpose.|

Design principles are also adhered to as much as possible. Each class has a clear singular purpose that is not repeated elsewhere in the code, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle for better readability and extensibility. The use of many design patterns helps our code be more organised and modular through the Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself Principle. We avoided code smells as much as possible, such as duplication, long methods, feature envy, and magic numbers. Many iterations were made through our project, such as reworking how all 3 controller classes input methods wokred, to avoid any anti-patterns, and as such the code has no god objects, spaghetti code, copy-paste programming, and singletons. 

## Design Goals

During the design and implementation process we used the following considerations:

|Design goal| Actions to take|
|--------|---|
|**Ease of Use**| - The user-interface should be simple and easy to use.<br></br> - Flow between different components of the UI should be easy to navigate.<br></br> - The features of the app must be intuitive and easy to learn.<br></br> - Each component of the app should have an information section which provides how-to-use insturctions to the user. |
|**Modularity**| - Different components of the app, e.g. mouse or keyboard, must be modular and seperate from one another.<br></br> - This means new app components can be added easily by future developers.<br></br> - Components which share common features, such as information dialog's, must implement a way to share them between each other while minimising duplicate code. |
|**Extendability**| - New components and UI features should be easy to add and implement.<br></br> - Extending the functionality of existing components should be intuitive for new developers. |
|**Consistiency**| - UI elements of the app should be consistient throughout different components.<br></br> - Coding conventions should be followed throughout the entire codebase to increase readability for future developers. |

## Backend Architecture

### High-Level Overview

The back-end of MotionInput Bluetooth controller is comprised of many components which are designed to deal with different aspects of the app functionality. We used an Object-Oriented approach to ensure modilarity between these components. This was essential as many of these componets dealt with completly different tasks to each other therefore by seperate and modular the readibility of the backend code-base was mainitained at a high level, even as the size of the app grew.

We firstly have a MainActivity class which serves as the entry point of the application and is main class in control of the lifecycle of the application. It is used to initialise and control all other classes of the application on boot and deals with deals with inflating UI resources by hosting them in a container.

Outside of MainActivity, the other classes can be grouped together into 4 general types:

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bluetooth | These set of classes contain all of the logic for dealing with Bluetooth connection and transmission of data. This includes: Bluetooth setup on app lanuch, making Bluetooth connections and sending data packets to the connected device. |
| Dialogs | These are the logic for UI popup elemets. They control the functionality of each popup which could include information popups or settings pages. |
| Fragments | These are the logic assiciated with each UI fragments. They control the functionality of each fragment and use callbacks to comminucate with the rest of the backend when a user interacts with respective UI elements. |
| Settings | This class deals with saving and loading values to the devices system preferences. It's methods are exposed to other classes in the back-end so they can easily retrieve specific parameters from the devices saved settings. |

The general types are then comprised of specific classes which define a specific component in that group:

### Bluetooth Components

  <div>
    <div>
         This is the main controller class for the component. It is instanciated at boot time and subsiquently instancetes the other bluetooth classes during it's setup.
