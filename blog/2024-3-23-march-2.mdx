## Final Blog Post: The Finished Product

The final few weeks of the term and project were spend finalising the app and getting it deployment ready. We started by working through all of the outstanding known bugs and slowly issuing fixes for all of them. We also focussed on final testing. This involved writing the final automated tests and getting our testing code coverage to a high level.

We also spent this time working on our portfolio website, this involved documenting and evaluating all aspects of the project across it's duration. This included gathering requirements, research, UI and system design, implementation, testing and evaluation.

At the end of the project we are pleased to write that we have successfullt met all requirements we outlined and have developed a deployment ready product.
