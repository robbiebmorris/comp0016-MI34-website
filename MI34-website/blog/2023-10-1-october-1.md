## Setting the Stage: Project Inception

Welcome to our first blog post! Today, we're introduction our Systems Engineering (COMP0016) project, a MotionInput Bluetooth Controller. From setting up our project repository to clarifying goals with the dean, we've been hard at work laying the foundation for an innovative and user-centric experience.

### 1. Project Repository Setup

Every great project starts with a well-organized and accessible repository. We kicked off our journey by creating a project repository on GitHub. This centralized hub serves as the backbone of our development process, providing version control, collaboration tools, and a space for seamless integration with other tools.

#### Key Repository Components:
- **README.md**: A comprehensive guide to the project, including installation instructions, project structure, and contribution guidelines.
- **Issue Tracker**: A place to log and discuss tasks, enhancements, bugs, and other project-related topics.
- **Branching Strategy**: Defined branches for features, bug fixes, and development staging, ensuring a streamlined development process.

### 2. Notion Page for Better Teamwork

Effective communication and collaboration are essential for the success of any project. To enhance our teamwork, we incorporated Notion into our workflow. Notion provides a centralized platform for documentation, task tracking, and knowledge sharing.

#### Notion Page Highlights:
- **Project Roadmap**: A visual representation of our project timeline, milestones, and deliverables.
- **Gantt Chart**: An interactive timeline with task dependencies and progress tracking.
- **Meeting Notes**: A record of discussions, decisions, and action items from our team meetings.
- **Requirements**: Detailed list of functional and non-functional requirements, including user stories, usability criteria, and specific system capabilities.

## Understanding User Needs: HCI Requirements Gathering

To prepare for our HCI presentation, we began with a deep dive into understanding user needs. We conducted surveys and interviews to gather valuable insights that would shape our project's direction.

#### User Requirements Highlights:
- **User Surveys**: Collected feedback on existing input methods and pain points experienced by users.
- **Interviews**: Engaged with potential users to understand their preferences, expectations, and challenges related to motion input.

## Clarifying Goals

We had a meeting with Prof Dean Mohamadally, our project mentor, to ensure that our goals and objectives were in sync with his.

#### Meeting Outcome:
- **Project Scope**: Defined the boundaries of our project to ensure a manageable and achievable scope.
- **Budget and Resources**: Discussed resource requirements and received necessary approvals for additional tools or equipment.
- **Timeline and Milestones**: Agreed upon a realistic timeline for project milestones and deliverables.
